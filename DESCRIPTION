Description: This package is based on functions from the "morse" package v3.3.1. 
          It allows performing forwards prediction for the General Unified 
          Threshold model of Survival using compiled ode code. This package 
          was created to avoid dependency with the "morse" package that requires 
          the installation of JAGS.
